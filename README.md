# ReadMeBroadcast

Composed of 3 different classes, this work can read RINEX broadcast ephemeris data and calculate navigation elements for a satellite.This set of files are rather easy to use and understand. Functions that are used are defined from scratch and dependence on built-in MATLAB functions is kept to a minimum. The code works on MATLAB 2015a without any hiccup.

This sort of information is rather hard to reach although it should not be.

It took quite some time to learn/understant/code this thing. I'm sharing it so you, stranger, should have an easier time learning it. You are free to do whatever you want to with this code. My humble advice would be in favour of learning/understanding etc. before using it.

Take care and have fun learning, it should be fun not pain!
